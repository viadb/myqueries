An identifier used to support row locking by multiple transactions.

A multixact ID is an internal identifier used  support row locking by multiple transactions.

Multixact IDs are created when transactions use "SELECT â€¦ FOR UPDATE" (or one of these lock modes: SHARE, KEY SHARE, NO KEY UPDATE) to lock and update tuples.

Multixact IDs live in the pg_multixact directory.

## Temporal tables and Multixact

Temporal tables can also exhaust the multixact capacity. For those, a VACUUM won't make much if it is not forced to do an aggressive scan (that is, 
not relying only on dead tuples but in xid).

- Check that no open backends, sessions or active are sticking temporal tables.
- Restart the instance, so temporal tables get removed from the pg_temp*.
